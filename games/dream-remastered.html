            <h1>A Dream within a Dream Remastered</h1>
            <p>
                A remake of one of the first games I worked on, together with Yogbert back in 2015.
                It's being made with the Godot engine.
                After remaking the original enemies, levels etc. I hope to include the features that
                we planned on implementing in the original game but didn't get around to.
                It's not finished yet, but all the levels from the original have been recreated and
                are playable.
                You can also find the original <a href="dream.html">here</a>.
