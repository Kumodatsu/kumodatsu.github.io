            <h1>Hotel Pluhz</h1>
            <p>
                A game commissioned by the Dutch company
                <a href="http://gezondaanzee.nl/pluhz/">Pluhz</a>.
                Made by WolfPatch, a group of twelve people including myself who worked on this game
                for the final project of the Computer Science bachelor at Utrecht University in
                2019.
                It's a 2D hotel building game where you unlock and build rooms, help guests and earn
                money.
                The main focus of the game is the real-life challenges the player can complete to
                earn a special type of currency with which more things can be unlocked.
                The challenges' purpose is to encourage the player to live a healthier lifestyle.

                The university provided us our own offices on the campus where we worked on the
                game, and discussed important things such as where to put the opening curly brace of
                a code block.
                These offices were also the birthplace of a vast collection of in-jokes, a lot of
                which related to tea.
                We also had our own mascot, Patchy (pictured).

                While we haven't made any games as WolfPatch since Hotel Pluhz, some of us are still
                talking regularly and keeping the WolfPatch spirit alive.
