            <h1>Polly</h1>
            <p>
                A game made with a small team as a project for Utrecht University in 2016-2017.
                The assignment was to reimagine an old classic game using modern tools.
                We decided to make a roguelike based on the game Rogue, with procedurally generated
                dungeons and randomly spawned enemies and loot.
                But in 3D.
                We used C# and the MonoGame framework to create it.
                We went for a low poly art style, and the protagonist character Polly was named
                after that.
            </p>

                Originally it was supposed to have an objective that the player has to find within
                the dungeon and then carry back out, like in the original Rogue.
                However, due to time constraints we didn't manage to implement this, so it instead
                became an endless dungeon crawling game where you just go as deep as you can before
                the enemies kill you.
            </p>
            <p>
                We often worked on the campus in one of the project rooms, with Bob Ross episodes
                playing on the big monitor in the background to inspire us.

                I will put up a download if I can get the permission of the other people who worked
                on this game.
